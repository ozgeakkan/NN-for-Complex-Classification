# NN-for-Complex-Classification

Built and fine-tuned deep neural network models to tackle a challenging tabular classification problem with complex, non-linear feature-target relationships. Performed extensive feature engineering on a noisy dataset, handled missing values and outliers, and systematically experimented with hyperparameters to boost predictive accuracy.
